# Module-15-Leaflet

Earthquake Mapper Challenge
Part 1: Earthquake Data Visualization Project

Start by acquiring my dataset.

Next, incorporate and render the data with these steps:

Utilize the Leaflet library to generate a map showcasing earthquake occurrences from your data, pinpointed by their geographic coordinates.

Design the data markers to visually indicate the earthquake's magnitude through their scale and depth through color variation. Markers representing larger magnitudes should be more prominent, and those indicating deeper earthquakes should display in darker hues.

Incorporate interactive popups to deliver detailed information about the earthquake upon clicking its marker on the map.

Add a legend to your map to serve as a guide for interpreting the data displayed, enhancing the user's understanding of the map's color and size markers.
